# Optimizing Plik Sticky Notes Build Process

This document provides information on how to optimize the Docker build process for the Plik Sticky Notes application to reduce build times.

## Build Time Issues

The standard Docker build process can take a long time (8+ minutes) due to:

- Large package installations in the Debian-based image
- Multiple separate layers for file operations
- Using git operations within the build
- Running the full release process during build

## Optimized Build Solution

### Using the Optimized Build Script

We've provided an optimized build script that significantly reduces build time:

```bash
# Basic build
./optimized-build.sh

# Build and push to Docker Hub
./optimized-build.sh -u your-dockerhub-username

# Build with improved caching
./optimized-build.sh -c
```

### Key Optimizations

1. **Reduced Docker Layers**: Combined multiple RUN and COPY commands into single operations
2. **Alpine-based Images**: Switched from Debian to Alpine for smaller, faster builds
3. **Direct Compilation**: Bypassed the git-based release process for direct compilation
4. **BuildKit**: Enabled Docker BuildKit for better caching and parallel operations
5. **Parallel Compilation**: Used parallel make and go build operations
6. **Optimized Copying**: Streamlined file copying operations
7. **Better .dockerignore**: Excluded unnecessary files from the build context

### Estimated Improvements

With these optimizations, the build time should be reduced by 50-70% depending on your hardware.

## Manual Optimizations

If you prefer to use the original Dockerfile, you can still improve build times by:

1. Enabling BuildKit:
```bash
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
```

2. Using build arguments for parallel compilation:
```bash
docker build --build-arg MAKEFLAGS="-j$(nproc)" -t stickynotes .
```

3. Improving caching:
```bash
docker build --build-arg BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1 -t stickynotes .
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the optimized build:

1. **Application Not Working**: The optimized build skips some release steps to improve build speed. If you encounter issues, you may need to revert to the original build process for full compatibility.

2. **Missing Files**: Check if all necessary custom files are copied to the correct locations. The optimized build assumes a specific file structure.

3. **Build Errors**: If you encounter build errors, try running with the `-c` flag to enable improved caching, or revert to the standard build process.
